This pack has been tested and may be used with the [Smilies Themer](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/smilies-themer/) plugin, however, it may also be used on its own. Full instructions for both in the readme.

== Installation ==

There are two ways that these icons can be installed and used in Wordpress. You can either replace the default Wordpress icons, or you can use the ["Smilies Themer"](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/smilies-themer/) plugin.

To replace the default Wordpress icons:

* Unpack this archive. It will create a directory named "scriptmonkeys-static".

* On your server, find the directory where you installed Wordpress. Under that directory, go to wp-includes/images/smilies.

* Copy all of the "*.gif" files from scriptmonkeys-static to smilies. Notice that files with the same names will already be there.

* The task is complete. You may not see the new images immediately if your browser has kept copies of the old images in its cache.

To use the Smilies Themer plugin (requires Wordpress 2.0.2 or later):

* Unpack this archive. It will create a directory named "scriptmonkeys-static".

* On Wordpress, install and activate the Smilies Themer plugin, if you haven't already.

* On your server, find the directory where you installed Wordpress. Under that directory, go to wp-content/plugins/smilies-themer.

* Copy the entire "scriptmonkeys-static" directory to the smilies-themer directory. In other words, when you are done, the directory structure will look like this: {Wordpress directory}/wp-content/plugins/smilies-themer/scriptmonkeys-static/{files}

* From your Wordpress admin dashboard, go to Settings - Smilies Themer. Under "Choose the default smilies theme", select "WP Basic Emotes by Scriptmonkeys" then click on "Update Options" to save. Make sure "Convert emoticions" is also checked.
